Quiz 8 – Imaging & Coding Inspiration

## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

**Chosen Technique**
> I’m inspired by Van Gogh’s Starry Night and Marcel Duchamp’s Rotoreliefs (1935). I want to borrow the swirling strokes and paint dots from Van Gogh, and the off-centered spinning patterns from Duchamp’s discs.

**Why I Chose It**  
> My “Wheels of Fortune” is made of painterly textures and circles. Animating these with swirling and off-centered motion makes the spin elegant and lively—like Starry Night in motion.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

**Coding Method**
>Using p5.js to Implement Image Rotation and Oil Painting Dot Effect.

**How It Helps**  
> This technique utilizes the rotate() function in p5.js to create a rotating image effect. It also combines a simulation of oil painting dot effects to enhance the visual appeal, making the image appear more artistic and dynamic.
